// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

// one way
playersCopy = players.slice()

// or create a new array and concat the old one in
playersCopy = [].concat(players)

// you can also use the js Array()
playersCopy = Array.from(players)

// or use the new ES6 Spread

// how do we take a copy instead?
personCopy = Object.assign({}, person)

// And now you can also use spread with objects (ES9).
personCopy = { ...person, speed: 89 }
